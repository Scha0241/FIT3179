Visualisation Dashboard for Insights into the Australian Aviation Industry
This visualisation explores Australiaâ€™s aviation industry, focusing on domestic airline routes, passenger flows, and airport operations. Key metrics such as passenger trips, aircraft trips, load factors, and distances between airports are presented using Vega-Lite, providing valuable insights for aviation authorities, policymakers, airlines, and researchers.

How It Works
The visualisation is created using Vega-Lite, a powerful grammar for interactive visualisation. Vega-Lite allows for complex data visualisations with simple specifications, which are then compiled into Vega and rendered using HTML, SVG, and Canvas.

Key Visualisations Include:
Route Connectivity Map: Displays key Australian airports and their connectivity based on the number of routes.
Flight Delays and Cancellations (Stacked Bar Chart): Compares operational reliability across airlines by showing delays and cancellations.
Airline Performance (Radar Chart): Compares Qantas, Jetstar, and Virgin Australia across several operational metrics like passenger load factor, trips, and cancellations.
Passenger Volume by City (Bar Chart): Presents trends in passenger traffic from major cities like Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane over time.
Aircraft Trips vs. Passenger Load Factor (Scatter Plot): Highlights the relationship between flight frequency and load factor efficiency for selected routes.
Data used for this visualisation was sourced from Australian Government Open Data and Humanitarian Data Exchange. The datasets were pre-processed using Python's Pandas library to ensure consistency and accuracy.
