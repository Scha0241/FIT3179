              <p><strong>Visual Overview:</strong> The visualisation provides an interactive overview of the connectivity of major airports across Australia. Each airport is represented by a circle, with larger circles indicating a greater number of routes, highlighting key hubs like Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane.</p> 
              <p><strong>Key Insights:</strong> Major hubs such as Sydney and Melbourne serve as primary gateways, supporting high passenger flow and extensive connectivity within Australia’s air travel network. Regional airports, although smaller, play an essential role in connecting remote areas, thus enhancing national accessibility. The chart emphasises the disparity in connectivity between larger hubs and regional airports, showcasing the significant role that major airports play in linking urban centres with less populated areas. The interactive feature allows viewers to hover over each airport to discover details like city name, IATA code, and number of routes, offering a deeper understanding of the Australian aviation landscape.</p>
