              <p><strong>Visual Overview:</strong> The visualisation provides an interactive overview of the connectivity of major airports across Australia. Each airport is represented by a circle, with larger circles indicating a greater number of routes, highlighting key hubs such as Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane.</p>

                <p><strong>Key Insights:</strong> Major hubs such as Sydney and Melbourne serve as primary gateways, supporting high passenger flow and extensive connectivity within Australia's air travel network. Regional airports, although smaller, play a crucial role in connecting remote areas, thereby enhancing national accessibility. The chart underscores the disparity in connectivity between major hubs and regional airports, showcasing the significant part played by the larger airports in linking urban centres with less populated regions.</p>

                <p>The interactive feature allows users to hover over each airport to uncover essential details such as the city name, IATA code, and number of routes, offering a deeper insight into the Australian aviation landscape. By exploring these connections, users can gain an understanding of the spatial distribution of airport operations and the importance of both major and regional hubs in facilitating domestic and international travel.</p>
                
                <p>Notably, Sydney emerges as the airport with the most connections, reinforcing its role as a major international gateway, while Melbourne is also prominent, acting as a central hub for both domestic and international routes. Regional airports, such as those in Western Australia and Queensland, are equally important for providing access to remote communities, thereby supporting regional economic growth and ensuring the mobility of residents in sparsely populated areas.</p>

              <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Airline Performance Radar Chart provides a comprehensive comparative analysis of Qantas, Jetstar, and Virgin Australia, focusing on key operational metrics such as on-time departures, arrivals, cancellations, and delays. The chart presents each airline’s performance as distinct lines, allowing for a clear visual assessment of operational strengths and weaknesses.</p>

              <p><strong>Performance Highlights:</strong> Virgin Australia shows a noticeable spike in cancellations and delayed departures, suggesting ongoing operational challenges. In contrast, Qantas exhibits consistency in both on-time departures and arrivals, standing out as the most reliable airline in this comparison. Jetstar, while performing fairly well in most metrics, still lags slightly behind Qantas in terms of punctuality and operational consistency.</p>

              <p><strong>Key Insights:</strong> The visual analysis helps identify specific areas where airlines excel or require improvement. For instance, Qantas consistently leads in punctuality, underscoring its efficient management, while Virgin Australia's elevated delays indicate potential process inefficiencies that need addressing. This comparison provides a valuable overview of each airline’s operational health, highlighting opportunities for enhancing service quality and efficiency.</p>
